   * Indirect Compensation: This includes the value of the benefits we provide, such as health insurance, retirement plan contributions, paid time off, and other non-monetary perks designed to support your well-being and professional growth.18


6.2 Performance Management


Effective performance management is a continuous, collaborative process between employees and their managers, designed to support individual development and align personal goals with company objectives. This process moves beyond a single annual event to a year-round cycle of communication and growth.19


6.2.1 Performance Planning and Goal Setting


At the beginning of each performance cycle (typically annually), you will work with your manager to establish clear performance and development goals. These goals should be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound) and directly support your team's and the company's broader objectives.21 This planning phase is the foundation of the performance cycle, ensuring you have a clear understanding of what is expected of you.19


6.2.2 Ongoing Feedback and Coaching


Continuous communication is critical to your success. Your manager is expected to provide regular, constructive feedback on your progress through informal discussions and scheduled one-on-one meetings.23 These check-ins are an opportunity to discuss achievements, address challenges, and adjust goals as needed. We encourage you to be an active participant in these conversations by seeking feedback and sharing your own perspective on your performance and development.24


6.2.3 Annual Performance Reviews


While feedback is ongoing, a formal performance review will be conducted at least once per year.23 This review is a comprehensive summary of your performance over the entire cycle. The process typically includes a self-assessment, your manager's written evaluation, and a face-to-face meeting to discuss your accomplishments, areas for growth, and goals for the next cycle.22 Your signature on the review form acknowledges that the discussion took place; it does not necessarily signify agreement with the assessment.24 The annual review is a key factor in decisions regarding compensation, promotions, and career development.21

aims to be fair and consistent when addressing issues of employee performance or conduct. While employment is at-will, the company generally follows a progressive discipline approach to provide employees with notice of deficiencies and an opportunity to improve.2


6.3.1 Progressive Discipline


The typical steps in our progressive discipline process are:
   1. Informal Discussion/Verbal Warning: A discussion between the employee and supervisor to address the issue.
   2. Written Warning: A formal, documented warning that outlines the problem, expectations for improvement, and potential consequences if improvement is not made.
   3. Final Written Warning / Suspension: A final warning indicating that failure to correct the issue will result in termination. In some cases, a suspension (with or without pay, as permitted by law) may be used.2
   4. Termination of Employment: If the issue is not corrected, employment may be terminated.
The company reserves the right to skip any step in this process and move directly to a more severe disciplinary action, including immediate termination, for serious offenses such as theft, harassment, violence, or major policy violations.2


6.3.2 Managing Underperformance (Performance Improvement Plans)


When an employee's performance is not meeting expectations, a manager, in consultation with HR, may implement a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP). A PIP is a formal tool designed to provide the employee with specific, measurable goals, a clear timeline (typically 30-90 days) for achieving them, and the support needed to succeed. The goal of a PIP is to help the employee improve their performance to an acceptable level. Failure to meet the terms of the PIP may result in further disciplinary action, including termination.23
